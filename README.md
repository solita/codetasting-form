# Solita Code Tasting - registering

This js thingie was used to collect applications from students to come code with us in a open Coding Dojo. Nothing fancy, a terminal emulator frontend with a simple python cgi to save the participants info and inform him/her that the application was received.

All heavy lifting was done by Michal Kowalkowski that authored the awesome cssConsole library: https://github.com/michalkow/cssConsole

## If you want to use this

..then do. But like you can see from the code all of the content is embedded in the js, so you need to be careful when editing it. Also take a moment to see what the Python script does even though it's pretty self explanatory.
